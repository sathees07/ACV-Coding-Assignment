### Model Evaluation

The evaluation phase is a critical step in assessing the performance of the YOLO model trained on the BDD100K dataset.

### Folder Structure for Evaluation

 It involves two main components:

#### 1\. Quantitative Evaluation

-   **Purpose:** Measure performance metrics like mAP, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-   **Steps:**

    1.  Run `quan_performance_eval.ipynb`.

    2.  Update the model path to point to the trained weights and run the validation process.

    3.  Extract standard evaluation metrics that numerically represent the model's detection performance.

#### 2\. Qualitative Evaluation

-   **Purpose:** Visualize predictions against ground truth and analyze failure cases to identify areas of improvement.

-   **Steps:**

    1.  Run `qual_performance_eval.py`.

    2.  Update the following paths in the script:

        -   `image_folder = "02_model_training/dataset/images/train/"`

        -   `txt_folder = "02_model_training/dataset/labels/train"`

        -   `output_folder = "output/train/"`

        -   `model_path = "02_model_training/runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt"`

    3.  Execute the script to generate visual comparisons of the model's predictions and ground truth annotations.

#### 3\. Failure Analysis

-   **Purpose:** Analyze the model's failure cases and understand where it performs poorly.

-   **Steps:**

    -   **Confusion Matrix:**

        -   Construct a confusion matrix to capture true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and class-wise misclassifications.

        -   Visualize the matrix using a heatmap for easy interpretation.

    -   **Error Analysis:**

        -   **False Positives (FP):** Identify incorrectly predicted objects, including their confidence scores.

        -   **False Negatives (FN):** Highlight undetected ground truth objects and their distribution across classes.

### Observation and Insights

#### 1\. Object Category Distribution

-   **Observation:**

    -   Analyze category imbalances and identify overrepresented or underrepresented classes.

-   **Insights:**

    -   Classes like "cars" may dominate, while rare classes like "trains" are underrepresented.

    -   This can lead to overfitting on frequent categories and poor generalization for rare ones.

-   **Actionable Recommendations:**

    -   **Data Augmentation:** Generate synthetic data for underrepresented classes.

    -   **Re-sampling:** Oversample rare categories.

    -   **Focus on Edge Cases:** Collect more real-world data for underrepresented or rare classes.

#### 2\. Bounding Box Statistics

-   **Observation:**

    -   Examine bounding box size, aspect ratios, and spatial placement.

-   **Insights:**

    -   Small bounding boxes dominate, leading to potential issues detecting large or unusual-shaped objects.

    -   Aspect ratios may reveal class-specific biases, such as wide boxes for cars and narrow ones for pedestrians.

-   **Actionable Recommendations:**

    -   **Data Augmentation:** Simulate bounding boxes of varying sizes and shapes for rare patterns.

    -   **Bounding Box Normalization:** Ensure uniform representation of box sizes during training.

    -   **Anchor Box Adjustment:** Tune anchor box sizes in models like YOLO to align with bounding box statistics.

#### 3\. Object Density Heatmaps

-   **Observation:**

    -   Identify spatial biases where objects are concentrated in specific regions.

-   **Insights:**

    -   High density in the horizontal center (e.g., roadways) suggests a focus on specific regions.

    -   Low density at image edges indicates poor representation of peripheral objects.

-   **Actionable Recommendations:**

    -   **Augment Peripheral Data:** Add data with objects at image edges.

    -   **Fine-Tune Region-Specific Features:** Use regional proposals or attention mechanisms to account for underrepresented areas.

#### 4\. Correlation Analysis

-   **Observation:**

    -   Examine the relationships between categories and environmental factors like time of day, weather, and scenes.

-   **Insights:**

    -   Certain categories (e.g., traffic lights) may correlate strongly with specific conditions (e.g., urban scenes).

    -   A lack of diversity in correlations indicates dataset biases.

-   **Actionable Recommendations:**

    -   **Diversify Dataset:** Collect samples for underrepresented correlations (e.g., traffic lights in rural areas).

    -   **Adjust Model Training:** Use conditional data augmentation or feature separation for better handling of correlated attributes.

#### 5\. Model Performance Connection

-   **Observation:**

    -   Use evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall) and misclassification analysis to connect patterns in performance to data biases.

-   **Insights:**

    -   Errors on specific classes or regions may indicate data gaps.

    -   Poor performance in low-light conditions could reflect a lack of night/dawn data.

-   **Actionable Recommendations:**

    -   **Targeted Data Collection:** Address specific errors by collecting data for challenging conditions (e.g., foggy weather, edge cases).

    -   **Loss Function Adjustment:** Use weighted losses to penalize misclassification of rare categories.

    -   **Cross-Validation:** Perform stratified validation based on category and environment splits to ensure generalization.
